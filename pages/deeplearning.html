      <h3>What is deep learning or deep structured learning?</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="text-left"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep Learning </a> or
        deep structured learning s part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural
        networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>

      <p class="text-left">Put simply, deep learning is a subset of machine learning which teaches machines to do what
        humans are naturally born with: learn by example. Though the technology is often considered a set of algorithms
        which ‘mimics the brain’, a more appropriate description would be a set of algorithms which ‘learns in layers’.
        It involves learning through layers that enable a computer to develop a hierarchy of complicated concepts from
        simpler concepts </p>

        Majority of the deep learning methods utilize neural network architectures and that’s why deep learning models
        are widely known as deep neural networks as well. A deep learning process consists of two key phases — training
        and inferring. The training phase can be considered as a process of labeling huge amounts of data and
        identifying their matching characteristics. Here, the system compares those characteristics and memorizes them
        to come up with correct conclusions when it encounters similar data next time. During the inferring phase, the
        model makes conclusions and labels unexposed data with the help of the knowledge it gained previously.

      <h3>Our Deep Learning Model </h3>
      <br>

      <p class="text-left"> For our deep learning model we used get_dummies to encode our categorical data (genre and
        director). We created the test train split (default 75/25) and scaled our data using the standard scaler. Lastly
        we used to_categorical to encode our target (rating class). Our model included 2 hidden layers with 100 nodes
        each. The accuracy on this model was 65%.</p>

      <h3>Advantages of Deep Learning</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="text-left"> One of deep learning’s main advantages over other machine learning algorithms is its
        capacity to execute feature engineering on it own. A deep learning algorithm will scan the data to search for
        features that correlate and combine them to enable faster learning without being explicitly told to do so.
        Deep learning algorithms can be trained using different data formats, and still derive insights that are
        relevant to the purpose of its training. For example, a deep learning algorithm can uncover any existing
        relations between pictures, social media chatter, industry analysis, weather forecast and more to predict future
        stock prices of a given company.
